Inputs: Outside temperature, number of people,

True output: Temperature of the building

**Formulas**: 
The formula is written in LaTeX format as follows:

$$\frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta} = 2 \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X} \theta - 2 \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{y} = 0$$

$$\theta = (\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1} \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{y}$$
