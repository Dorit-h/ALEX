Spoiler Alert: 1-Layer Neural Network

**Images**:
There is only one image in the document. It is a graph showing a sigmoid function. The graph has a blue curve that starts at the bottom left corner of the graph and approaches 1 as the input values increase. The x-axis ranges from -6 to 6, and the y-axis ranges from 0 to 1.

**Formulas**:
The formula for the sigmoid function is:

$$\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$$

where e is the base of the natural logarithm.

In LaTeX format, the formula would be:

$$\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1+\text{e}^{-x}}$$

Additionally, the formula for the probability of a binary classification problem is given as:

$$p(y_i = 1 \mid x_i, \theta) = \sigma(x_i)$$

In LaTeX format, the formula would be:

$$p(y_i = 1 \mid x_i, \theta) = \sigma(x_i)$$

**Answer**: The text content is "Spoiler Alert: 1-Layer Neural Network". There is one image which is a graph showing a sigmoid function. The formulas are the sigmoid function and the probability of a binary classification problem.
