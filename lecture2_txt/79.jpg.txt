**Images**: There are two images in the diagram. The first image is a square with an orange border, and it contains a mathematical equation. The second image is also a square with an orange border, and it contains another mathematical equation.

**Formulas**: $$p(y\mid\mathbf{X}, \theta) = \hat{y} = \frac{1}{1 - \hat{y}_i}$$ $$n\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\log(\hat{y}_i(1 - \hat{y}_i))$$ $$-\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i \log \hat{y}_i + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y}_i)$$
