The image presents a visual representation of the sigmoid function, a fundamental concept in machine learning and statistics. The sigmoid function is used to model binary outcomes and is commonly employed in logistic regression.

**Sigmoid Function**

The sigmoid function is defined as:

$\sigma(x)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$

where $x$ is the input variable, and $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm. The sigmoid function maps any real-valued number to a value between 0 and 1, making it suitable for modeling binary outcomes.

**Probability of a Binary Outcome**

The probability of a binary outcome, denoted as $p(y_i=1|x_i,\theta)$, can be expressed using the sigmoid function:

$p(y_i=1|x_i,\theta)=\sigma(x)$

where $x_i$ is the input feature vector, $\theta$ is the model parameter, and $y_i$ is the binary outcome.

**Interpretation**

The sigmoid function can be interpreted as a probability distribution over binary outcomes. The output of the sigmoid function represents the probability of a positive outcome, with values close to 0 indicating a low probability and values close to 1 indicating a high probability.

**Conclusion**

In summary, the sigmoid function is a crucial component in machine learning and statistics, used to model binary outcomes and estimate probabilities. Its definition, representation, and interpretation are essential concepts in understanding machine learning models and statistical analysis.
