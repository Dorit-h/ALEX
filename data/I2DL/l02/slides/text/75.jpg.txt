**Text Content**: Logistic Regression, Probability of a binary output, The prediction of our sigmoid, I2DL: Prof. Niessner, 85

**Images**: There are two images in the slide. The first image is a diagram illustrating the concept of logistic regression, which shows how the probability of a binary output is calculated using a sigmoid function. The second image is an arrow pointing to the formula for the sigmoid function, which is y = σ(xiθ).

**Formulas**: The formulas present in the image are:

* y = p(y = 1|X, θ) = ∫[n] p(yi = 1|xi, θ) 
* yi = σ(xiθ)

where:

* y is the binary output
* X is the input data
* θ is the model parameters
* n is the number of data points
* yi is the binary output for each data point
* xi is the input data for each data point
* σ is the sigmoid function

The formula for the sigmoid function is:

σ(xiθ) = 1 / (1 + exp(-xiθ))

where exp is the exponential function.
