**Text Content**: Machine Learning; Given i images with train labels; Model Params; Model; Image; Class Label; θ* = argmin θ Σi D(Mθ(Ii) - Yi); "Distance" function; {DOG, CAT}; Mθ(I) = {DOG, CAT};

**Images**:  
•   The image shows a cat wearing a tie.
•   The image shows a dog lying on the grass.
•   The image shows a cat wearing glasses.
•   The image shows a dog biting a bone.
•   The image shows a cat wearing a tie.
•   The image shows a dog lying on the grass.

**Formulas**: 
$$
\theta^* = \argmin_\theta \sum_i D\left(M_\theta(I_i) - Y_i\right)
$$
