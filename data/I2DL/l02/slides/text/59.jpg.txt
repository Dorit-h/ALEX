**Text Content**: Maximum Likelihood Estimate; MLE assumes that the training samples are independent and generated by the same probability distribution; "i.i.d." assumption

**Images**: 

*   The first image is a logo of the word "Prof." in gray and the word "Niessner" in smaller gray font.
*   The second image is a logo of a gray line drawing of a person wearing a hat with a beard and mustache, and the words "I2DL" in gray.

**Formulas**: 

*   $p_{\text{model}}(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x},\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \prod_{i=1}^n p_{\text{model}}(y_i|\mathbf{x}_i,\boldsymbol{\theta})$
*   $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ is a vector of parameters that represent the model's parameters.

**Summary**: The image contains text content related to Maximum Likelihood Estimate, images of logos, and formulas for probability distributions. The text content explains the concept of MLE and its assumptions, while the images show logos of Prof. Niessner and I2DL. The formulas provide mathematical representations of the probability distributions used in MLE.
