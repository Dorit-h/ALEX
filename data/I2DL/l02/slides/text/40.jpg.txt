**Text Content**, **Images**, and **Formulas** extraction and description:

**Text Content**: The image contains the following text content:
* "Linear Prediction"
* "Prediction"
* "Input features (one sample has d features)"
* "Model parameters (d weights and 1 bias)"
* "y = XÎ¸"
* "x11 ... x1d"
* "Model parameters (d weights and 1 bias)"

**Images**: There are no images in this document.

**Formulas**:

The following formula is present in the image:

$$
\hat{y}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} x_{11} & \dots & x_{1d} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \theta_0 \\ \theta_1 \\ \vdots \\ \theta_d \end{bmatrix}
$$

This formula represents a linear prediction model, where $\hat{y}_1$ is the predicted output, $x_{11} ... x_{1d}$ are the input features, and $\theta_0 ... \theta_d$ are the model parameters.
