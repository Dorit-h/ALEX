The image presents a mathematical formula for linear prediction, accompanied by a list of variables and their corresponding values. The formula is:

\[y_1 = \frac{1}{\hat{y}_1} = \frac{1}{\hat{y}_2} = \frac{1}{\hat{y}_3} = \frac{1}{\hat{y}_4} = \frac{1}{\hat{y}_5} = \frac{1}{\hat{y}_6} = \frac{1}{\hat{y}_7} = \frac{1}{\hat{y}_8} = \frac{1}{\hat{y}_9} = \frac{1}{\hat{y}_{10}}\]

where:

*   \(y_1\) represents the temperature of the building
*   \(\hat{y}_1\) to \(\hat{y}_{10}\) represent the bias, outside temperature, humidity, number of people, sun exposure (%), and model values for each variable

The variables and their corresponding values are listed below the formula, with each variable labeled and its value displayed to the right. The variables and their values are:

*   Bias: 1
*   Outside temperature: 25
*   Humidity: 50
*   Number of people: 2
*   Sun exposure (%): 50
*   Model: 0.2

The image also includes a logo in the bottom-left corner, which reads "I2DL: Prof. Niessner".

In summary, the image presents a mathematical formula for linear prediction, accompanied by a list of variables and their corresponding values. The formula and variables are displayed in a clear and organized manner, making it easy to understand and interpret.
