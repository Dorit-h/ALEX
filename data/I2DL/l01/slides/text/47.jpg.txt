The image is a slide from a presentation about deep learning at TUM, with the title "Deep Learning at TUM" in blue text at the top. The slide features two images side by side, each showing a man in a blue shirt and jeans, with his hand extended as if reaching out to something. The left image has a black box on the left side with white text that reads "FlowNet", followed by a list of names: "P. Fischer, A. Dosovitskiy, E. Ilg, P. Hau√üer, C. Hazirbas, V. Golkov, P. v.d. Smagt, D. Cremers, T. Brox". The right image has a similar black box on the left side with the same text and list of names, but with the addition of "Img2" in green text above the image.
