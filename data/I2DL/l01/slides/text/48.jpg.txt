Multiple object tracking with graph neural networks

|Brasó and Leal-Taixé, CVPR 2020| Learning a Neural Solver for Multiple Object Tracking.

**Images**:;

The image shows a diagram of multiple object tracking with graph neural networks. The diagram consists of several components, including input, graph construction and feature encoding, neural message passing, edge classification, and output.

*   **Input**: This component represents the input data, which can be images or videos containing objects to be tracked.
*   **Graph Construction and Feature Encoding**: This component constructs a graph from the input data and encodes features from the graph into a vector representation.
*   **Neural Message Passing**: This component passes messages between nodes in the graph to update the feature representations.
*   **Edge Classification**: This component classifies the edges of the graph to determine the relationships between objects.
*   **Output**: This component outputs the tracked objects and their trajectories.

**Formulas**:

There are no formulas in the image.
